## Technical Considerations

As we continue development, we need to address these technical considerations:

1. **Reference Resolution**: Create a strategy to properly resolve ESPN API's `$ref` fields into normalized database entities.

2. **Temporal Data Management**: Enforce consistent UTC time formatting for all date/time fields to support historical analysis.

3. **Memory Management**: Implement regular maintenance routines to manage DuckDB's memory usage for indexes.

4. **Data Synchronization**: Design pipelines to handle real-time updates during active game periods.

5. **Data Retention**: Define policies for historical data retention and archiving strategies.

6. **API Rate Limiting**: Implement request throttling to respect ESPN's API rate limits.

7. **Error Handling**: Develop robust error handling for API unavailability or schema changes.

## Open Questions

Several questions remain open and require further investigation:

- How should we handle very sparse statistical fields that only apply to certain athletes or game situations?

- What is the best storage format for historical time-series analysis of player development?

- Should we implement a separate star schema for analytical queries on top of this normalized structure?

- How frequently should aggregate statistics be recalculated?

- What is the optimal backup strategy for a DuckDB-based analytics database?

- How should we handle ESPN API schema changes or deprecations?

- What is the proper approach for handling team identity changes (rebrands, relocations) over time?

## Timeline
