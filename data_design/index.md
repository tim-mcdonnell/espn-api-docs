# ESPN API Data Structure Documentation

Welcome to the comprehensive documentation for the ESPN API data structure. This documentation outlines our normalized database design for efficiently storing and analyzing sports data from the ESPN API.

## Purpose

This documentation serves as both a design reference and implementation guide for our ESPN API data management system. It provides detailed information about:

- The overall database schema and entity relationships
- Table structures, columns, and relationships
- Indexing strategies optimized for analytical queries
- Implementation guidelines for working with the database

## Audience

This documentation is intended for:

- **Database Architects**: Who need to understand the overall structure
- **Data Engineers**: Who need to implement ETL processes
- **Analysts**: Who need to write efficient queries against the data
- **Developers**: Who need to build applications using the database

## Database Platform

Our implementation is built on [DuckDB](https://duckdb.org/), an analytical database system that provides:

- High-performance analytical query capabilities
- Columnar storage optimized for sports analytics workloads
- Embedded operation with minimal operational overhead
- SQL compatibility with advanced analytical functions

## Core Design Principles

Our data structure follows these key principles:

1. **Normalized Design**: Tables are normalized to minimize redundancy while supporting analytical needs
2. **Dimensional Modeling**: Clear separation of dimension and fact tables
3. **Analytical Optimization**: Structure optimized for common sports analytics queries
4. **Temporal Consistency**: Effective dating for time-variant relationships
5. **Extensibility**: Design accommodates new sports, leagues, and metrics

For more on our design approach, see the [Database Principles](database-principles.md) section.

## Database Structure Overview

Our normalized structure uses the following principles:

- Separate dimension and fact tables
- Consistent use of surrogate keys
- Proper foreign key relationships
- Appropriate handling of historical data
- Efficient storage of nested/hierarchical data
